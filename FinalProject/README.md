It retrieves the user's ID from the session and fetches the corresponding username from the database. Then it selects all emails where the user's username matches the recipient field and renders the emails on the index.html template.Compose: The route /compose allows the user to write and send an email. If the request method is GET, it retrieves the sender's username from the database and renders the compose.html template. If the method is POST, it retrieves the sender, recipient, subject, and body from the form submission. It performs basic validation to ensure none of the fields are empty. If the validation passes, it inserts the email details into the database and redirects to the /sent route.Sent: The route /sent displays all the emails sent by the logged-in user. It fetches the user's username from the database and selects all emails where the username matches the sender field. The emails are then rendered on the index.html template.Login: The route /login allows users to log in. If the method is GET, it renders the login.html template. If the method is POST, it retrieves the username and password from the form submission. It checks if the username exists in the database and if the password matches the stored hash. If the credentials are valid, it stores the user's ID in the session and redirects to the home page.Logout: The route /logout logs out the user by clearing the session and redirecting to the login form.Email: The route /email allows users to view the details of a specific email. If the method is POST, it retrieves the email ID from the form submission, fetches the email details from the database, and renders the email.html template with the email details.Register: The route /register allows users to register for a new account. If the method is GET, it renders the register.html template. If the method is POST, it retrieves the email, password, and confirm password from the form submission.
